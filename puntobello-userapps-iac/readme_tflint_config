# With this file the behavior of the Terraform linter (TFLint) can be modified.
# TFLint has several built in rules which are all activated in the CIN builder image.

# If you need for any reason to disable some of the TFLint rules do the following:
#  1. Rename this file to .tflint.hcl
#  2. Add a section like the following to this file:
#
# rule "terraform_dash_in_data_source_name" {
#   enabled = false
# }

# For a list of available rule see https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/tree/master/docs/rules#terraform-rules
# If your build fails because of a TFLint rule you would see in the output against which rule your code violates. 

# If you don not want to modify the behavior of TFLint you can delete this file or just leave it as it is.
