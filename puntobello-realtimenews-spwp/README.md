### Features
The webpart includes the following features:
- Displays news in a custom format, with a configurable number of news items shown through webpart properties.
- Shows one sticky news item, which is prominently displayed at the beginning of the news feed.
- Filters news by channels.
- Manages user preferences for channel subscriptions.

### Data Sources
The following data sources are used by the webpart:
- The `Realtime News` list, where the news items reside and are rendered by the webpart.
- The `Subscribed Channels` list, where user channel subscriptions are stored. Users can manage their subscription preferences directly in the webpart.
- A termstore group where the list of channels is stored.
- A socket server where the webpart connects and listens to events such as "a new news item is available" or "a news item has been updated."

### Realtime News List
All of these fields are automatically generated or updated through the [PuntoBello Realtime News Installer](../README.md#minimal-path-to-awesome). The following list is for documentation purposes only. You should not modify list items directly.

| Image url      | Link or Image           | URL of the image.                                                           |
| Header         | Multiple Lines of Text  | Header text that will be displayed.                                         |

| Channels       | Single Line of Text     | Channels associated with this news item.                                    |
| Published from | Date and Time           | Start date to determine if the news item should be displayed.               |
| Published to   | Date and Time           | End date to determine if the news item should be displayed.                 |

### Subscribed Channels List
All of these fields are automatically generated or updated by the webpart.

| Fieldname  | Fieldtype   | Description                                           |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Subscribed | Person/Group| The user to whom this setting belongs.                |
| Channels   | Metadata    | The subscribed channels.                              |

### Termstore for Channels
Channels are defined in the SharePoint termstore to ensure multilingual support across the solution.

### Webpart Socket Server
This webpart automatically connects with a socket server (URL is defined in the webpart parameters). The socket server emits various events, which are ingested by the webpart. This implementation ensures the following events are processed:
- `New news`: Displays a popup that draws the user's attention and allows them to refresh the news feed.
- `Update news`: Updates the news feed directly. The implementation dispatches the reads over a 30-second timespan to prevent overwhelming the SharePoint service with requests.

### Newsfeed Rendering Logic
The news items are queried using various parameters:
1. **Language Code**: The webpart shows news according to the language code set in the webpart property.
2. **Channels/Location**: News items may belong to multiple channels and address specific locations. Channels and locations can also be targeted hierarchically. The webpart ensures relevant news is displayed.
3. **Publishing Datetime**: From/to dates to determine whether a news item should be shown.
4. **Termstore Cache**: Termstore data is cached for 12 hours to improve performance.

### _Note_
- Uses PnP-JS library for all REST interactions with SharePoint.

### Parameters
You can configure all parameters in the corresponding files located in the `env` directory. Once set, build the solution accordingly.
